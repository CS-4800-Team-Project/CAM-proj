Project Name: Yum Magnet

Yum Magnet was developed as a web application project so that people may find recipes based off of search criteria with the help of an online database. 
The application provides users with a very clean cut, direct interface where they can easily accomplish these tasks.
In order to create the application, the languages Python and HTML were employed for the apps backend and frontend functionality, respectively.
Flask API is implemented to aid in the storage component of the apps backend; Selenium is utilized as a part of the apps scrapper file.
